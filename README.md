# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud-using-ML-Algorithms
Detecting fraud transactions is of great importance for any credit card company. Our task is to detect potential frauds so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. So the goal is to build a classifier that tells if a transaction is a fraud or not. We're doing this using the Random Forest Classifier.

# Random Forest
Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for both classification as well as regression. But however, it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees means more robust forest. Similarly, random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects the best solution by means of voting. It is an ensemble method which is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.

# Pros
- It overcomes the problem of overfitting by averaging or combining the results of different decision trees.
- Random forests work well for a large range of data items than a single decision tree does.
- Random forest has less variance then single decision tree.
- Random forests are very flexible and possess very high accuracy.
- Scaling of data is not required in random forest algorithm. It maintains good accuracy even after providing data without scaling.
- Random Forest algorithms maintains good accuracy even a large proportion of the data is missing.

# Cons
- Complexity is the main disadvantage of Random forest algorithms.
- Construction of Random forests are much harder and time-consuming than decision trees.
- More computational resources are required to implement Random Forest algorithm.
- It is less intuitive in case when we have a large collection of decision trees.
- The prediction process using random forests is very time-consuming in comparison with other algorithms.
